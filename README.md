# DegreeToDouble
Very simple converter that can be compiled on mac or linux to convert complicated coordinates like N 51Â° 53' 39,26 to a nice double format.

This tool is for my own use but feel free to copy it if you like. There are no checks so this is not suitable for production use.

To compile run
```
make && make clean
```
Then run 
```
./convert
```
